# Soft Skills Classroom Activities

This README describes two simple, peer-driven activities designed for college students. These activities focus on confidence, communication, leadership, and decision-making. Teacher involvement is minimal; students interact mainly with each other.

## 1. Internship Interview Role-Play

Skill Focus: Confidence, interview readiness, communication

### Setup

* Divide students into groups of 3
* Each group assigns roles:

  * Interviewer: asks questions and maintains a professional tone
  * Candidate: answers questions as if attending a real internship interview
  * Observer: silently watches and evaluates

### Situation

Students imagine they are applying for their first internship at a company. This is their initial screening interview.

### Interview Questions

The interviewer asks the candidate:

1. Tell me about yourself
2. What skills do you have?
3. Why should we select you for this internship?

### Observer Responsibilities

The observer focuses on:

* Confidence (voice clarity, calmness)
* Clear and structured answers
* Body language (eye contact, posture)

### Flow

* Interview runs for 5–7 minutes
* Observer gives short feedback
* Roles are rotated so every student experiences each role

### Learning Outcome

Students understand how interviews feel, improve confidence, and learn how communication and body language affect interview performance.
